Enables multiple featured images for posts and pages.

== Description ==

= Multiple featured images =

This plugin allows you to add additional featured images to a post or page. 

= Features =

1. Add as many featured images as you need
1. Fully customizable output - so it's multilingual

= History =

For one of my customers I had to assign two featured images to pages. One featured image was used as the
header image and the other as a small button for the submenu. The images had to be different too (so I couldn't 
simply use different images sizes) and so I wrote this little plugin.

= You = 

Feel free to ask if you have problems with this plugin. Feature requests are welcome too! And please correct my 
bad english if it bugs you. ;)

                'id' => 'featured-image-2',
                'post_type' => 'post',      // Set this to post or page

                'labels' => array(
                    'name'      => 'Featured image 3',
                    'set'       => 'Set featured image 3',

        );

        new kdMultipleFeaturedImages( $args1 );
        new kdMultipleFeaturedImages( $args2 );


= How do I use a different size of the featured image? =

Simply add the size to the function call:

        kd_mfi_the_featured_image( 'featured-image-2', 'page', 'full' );

You can choose every size that WordPress knows.

= How can I get the ID of the featured image? =

With this function call you can get the ID:

        kd_mfi_get_featured_image_id( 'featured-image-2', 'page' );
        
*Note:* Since a featured image has only one individual id, there is no option 'size' in this function call.

= How can I get the URL of the featured image? =

With this function call you can get the URL:

        kd_mfi_get_featured_image_url( 'featured-image-2', 'page', 'full' );
